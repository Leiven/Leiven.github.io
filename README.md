# How to Host and Format a Resume

A guide on how to host and format a resumé using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and a working repository.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) formatting knowledge.

## Instructions

These instructions will guide you on how to create and host your own Markdown formatted resumé on GitHub Pages.

    Once you have logged in to GitHub:

1. **Create** a [__new public__ repository](https://github.com/new).
2. **Name** the new repository as _username_.github.io where *username* is your GitHub username.
3. After the creation of the repository, press the "**Add file**" drop down 
4. Click "**Create new file**":

> You will be sent to a new page after clicking the Create new file option.

5. Above the big text box, **name** the new file we created as **index.md** 

6. **Click** the **Commit changes** to save the file on our repository.

> This will be the homepage of our GitHub page.

7. Now, we can create our resumé by typing it down on the *index.md* file that we have just created with the appropriate [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) formatting.

> (optional) If we want to add Jekyll styles to our GitHub page that hosts our resumé, proceed with the next steps:

8. **Add** another file by using **Create new file**.

9. **Name** the new file as **_config.yml**.
> This file will contain the theme that we would prefer to use on our GitHub page.

10. **Click** the *_config.yml* file that we just created.

11. On the main page, **click** the pencil icon to edit the file we just created.

12. **Add** the line "theme: " and then put the preferred style that we prefer. 

> For this guide, we can just **add** the following line: "theme: jekyll-theme-slate"

13. After adding our preferred style, **click** the **Commit changes** to save and update the file on our repository.

14. **Done!** We can now view our hosted resumé at *username*.github.io
